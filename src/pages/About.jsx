      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a passionate software engineer with a background in full-stack
        development, specializing in building innovative and user-friendly
        applications. With experience in frontend and backend technologies such
        as JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Java, I thrive on creating solutions
        that improve the user experience across web and mobile platforms. I
        enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies
        and refine my skills, whether it's integrating APIs, optimizing CI/CD
        pipelines, or enhancing mobile app functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a strong foundation in Computer Information Systems and have
        honed my skills through hands-on projects and coding boot camps. I am
        dedicated to continuous learning, with recent training focused on cloud
        technologies, advanced JavaScript frameworks, and best practices in
        software development. My approach is collaborative, detail-oriented, and
        driven by a desire to deliver high-quality results that make a
        difference.

        Outside of coding, I enjoy tackling personal challenges and finding ways
        to give back, such as participating in team-building events that support
        causes I care about. I believe in the power of technology to drive
        positive change, and I am excited to continue growing and contributing
        to impactful projects.
